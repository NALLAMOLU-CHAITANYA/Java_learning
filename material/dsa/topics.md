Bitwise operators

Time and space complexity

Recursion, Bcktracking

sorting techniques ( Bubble, insertion, selection, merge, count, heap, quick, java inbuilt sort = tim sort) (simplified masters theorem -> for time complexity)

searching (linear, binary)

Hashing (collision resolution techniques = open addressing (linear probing, quadratic probing), seperate chaining (linked list, bbst))

Hashing on strings

strings (basics, double hashing and robin karp method for souble hasing)

Game theory (optimal vs greedy, nims game) (sieve of primes/eartosthenes)

arrays

Mixed bag problems

stacks, queues (implement array using stacks, implement queue using stack, dynamic arrays)

linked lists (single, doubly, circular LLs)

trees (pre, in, post order) (Binary tree, Binary search tree, ) (left, right, top, down, mirror views) (level order traversal (BFS, DFS)) (vertical lvel order traversal)

tries

priority queues (min,max heaps)

greedy programming

DP (memoization vs tabulation)

Graphs & graph algos (Dijkstra`s, kruksal, topological sorting, biparate graphs)
