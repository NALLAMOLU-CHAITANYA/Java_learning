3. "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
Best for: Interview preparation

Why it helps: Strong section on recursion and backtracking with problems like subset generation, string permutations, coin change, etc.

Includes: Step-by-step recursion tree breakdowns.

4. "Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena
Best for: Computer science foundations

Why it helps: Covers recursion and backtracking formally and gives insight into when to use each.

Bonus: Has real-world problem examples, not just puzzles.

5. "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley
Best for: Thinking recursively

Why it helps: Focuses on recursive problem solving and elegant code. Great for sharpening problem-solving thought process.
