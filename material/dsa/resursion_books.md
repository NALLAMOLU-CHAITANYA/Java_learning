1. "Grokking Algorithms" by Aditya Bhargava
Best for: Beginners

Why it helps: Uses visuals and simple language to teach recursion. Covers recursion through divide & conquer examples (like merge sort, quicksort).

Backtracking: Introduced lightly via problems like subset sum and shortest paths.

2. "Elements of Programming Interviews" (EPI) by Aziz, Lee, Prakash
Best for: Intermediate to Advanced

Why it helps: Has many recursive/backtracking problems like permutations, combinations, Sudoku, N-Queens, etc.

Languages: Java, Python, C++ editions available.

3. "Cracking the Coding Interview" by Gayle Laakmann McDowell
Best for: Interview preparation

Why it helps: Strong section on recursion and backtracking with problems like subset generation, string permutations, coin change, etc.

Includes: Step-by-step recursion tree breakdowns.

4. "Algorithm Design Manual" by Steven Skiena
Best for: Computer science foundations

Why it helps: Covers recursion and backtracking formally and gives insight into when to use each.

Bonus: Has real-world problem examples, not just puzzles.

5. "Programming Pearls" by Jon Bentley
Best for: Thinking recursively

Why it helps: Focuses on recursive problem solving and elegant code. Great for sharpening problem-solving thought process.
